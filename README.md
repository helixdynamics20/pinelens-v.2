### Data Flow
1. User submits search query through the UI
2. Query is processed and sent to connected services
3. Raw results are collected from multiple sources
4. AI processes and ranks results for relevance
5. Enhanced results are displayed with metadata and insights

#### GitHub
1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` and `read:org` permissions
3. Note your username and the generated token

#### Jira
1. Go to Atlassian Account Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí API tokens
2. Create a new API token
3. Note your email and the generated token

#### Confluence
1. Go to Atlassian Account Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí API tokens
2. Create a new API token (same as Jira)
3. Note your email and the generated token

#### Microsoft Teams
1. Register an app in Azure AD
2. Grant Microsoft Graph permissions (`Chat.Read`, `Files.Read.All`, etc.)
3. Get an OAuth token from your app

#### Slack
1. Create a Slack app at api.slack.com
2. Add bot token scopes (`channels:read`, `files:read`, `chat:read`, etc.)
3. Install the app and use the Bot User OAuth Token

### 2. Adding Servers to PineLens

1. Click the "Add Server" button in the MCP Connections section
2. Select your service type
3. Enter a connection name
4. Provide the server URL (pre-filled with defaults)
5. Enter your authentication credentials
6. Click "Add Server"

### 3. MCP Server Requirements

PineLens expects MCP servers to support the following WebSocket protocol:

#### Connection
- WebSocket endpoint: `wss://your-server.com/mcp`
- Authentication via initial message

#### Message Types

**Authentication:**
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "credentials": {
    "type": "token|basic|oauth|api_key|bot_token",
    "token": "your-token",
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
  }
}
```

**Search Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "search",

  "model": "gpt-4",
  "filters": {
    "dateRange": { "start": "2024-01-01", "end": "2024-12-31" },
    "author": "john.doe",
    "type": "issue"
  }
}
```

- **SearchBar**: Provides search interface with AI model selection
- **MCPConnections**: Manages server connections and status
- **SearchResults**: Displays and filters search results

### Customization

You can customize PineLens by:

1. **Adding new AI models**: Update the `mockAIModels` array in `App.tsx`
2. **Supporting new services**: Add new server types to `MCPServerSetup.tsx`
3. **Modifying search filters**: Extend the search interface in `SearchBar.tsx`
4. **Styling**: Update Tailwind classes throughout the components

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Netlify

The project includes automatic Netlify deployment configuration. Simply connect your repository to Netlify for automatic deployments.

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials are stored locally in the browser
- WebSocket connections use secure protocols (WSS)
- No credentials are sent to external services except the configured MCP servers
- Consider implementing additional encryption for sensitive data
