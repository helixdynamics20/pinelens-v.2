# PineLens Search Testing Guide

## 🚀 **Search Functionality Fixed!**

Your PineLens search interface now supports all search modes with GitHub PAT token integration. Here's how to test each mode:

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Configure GitHub Token (If Not Already Done)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a token with `repo`, `user`, and `read:org` scopes
3. Copy the token
4. In PineLens, the system will automatically detect and configure your GitHub service

### 2. Verify GitHub Integration
- Check browser console for logs like "Auto-configuring GitHub service from stored token"
- Your GitHub token should be automatically configured for app search

## 🧪 **Testing All Search Modes**

### 📱 **Apps Mode Testing**
**What it does**: Searches your connected services (GitHub, Jira, etc.)

**How to test**:
1. Select "Apps" search mode (smartphone icon)
2. Enter a search query like "authentication" or "API"
3. Should return:
   - Your GitHub repositories matching the query
   - GitHub issues from your repos
   - GitHub pull requests
   - Results will show with GitHub as the source

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ GitHub repositories you own/contribute to
✅ Issues from your accessible repos
✅ Pull requests with matching content
✅ Real data from your GitHub account
```

### 🌐 **Web Mode Testing**
**What it does**: Simulated web search (demo functionality)

**How to test**:
1. Select "Web" search mode (globe icon)
2. Enter any search query
3. Should return:
   - Stack Overflow style results
   - Documentation links
   - Web-like content (demo)

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ Stack Overflow discussion about your query
✅ Documentation links
✅ Web search simulation results
```

### 🤖 **AI Mode Testing**
**What it does**: AI-powered analysis and responses

**How to test**:
1. Select "AI" search mode (bot icon)
2. Enter a question like "How to implement JWT authentication?"
3. Should return:
   - AI analysis using your available models
   - GitHub Copilot Pro responses (if configured)
   - Detailed AI-generated content

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ AI analysis from available models
✅ GitHub Copilot Pro responses (if you have subscription)
✅ Comprehensive AI-generated insights
✅ Model-specific responses with provider labels
```

### 🔄 **Unified Mode Testing**
**What it does**: Combines all search modes for comprehensive results

**How to test**:
1. Select "Unified" search mode (layers icon) - default
2. Enter a comprehensive query like "React hooks best practices"
3. Should return:
   - App results (GitHub repos, issues)
   - Web results (documentation, forums)
   - AI analysis (intelligent insights)

**Expected Results**:
```
✅ GitHub repositories about React hooks
✅ Issues discussing hooks
✅ Web documentation links
✅ AI analysis of best practices
✅ Mixed result types with different sources
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

### Console Logs to Look For:
```
🔍 Starting app search with query: [your query]
🔧 GitHub token found, ensuring service is configured...
📱 Enabled services: GitHub (github)
📊 Found X app results
🌐 Found X web results (demo)
🤖 Using AI models: [available models]
🤖 Generated X AI results
```

### GitHub Integration Status:
- Check localStorage for 'github_token'
- Verify service auto-configuration in console
- Confirm API calls to github.com/user/repos

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now**

### ✅ **Fixed Issues**:
1. **GitHub PAT Integration**: Automatically configures GitHub service from stored token
2. **All Search Modes**: Apps, Web, AI, and Unified all functional
3. **Real GitHub Data**: Pulls your actual repositories, issues, and PRs
4. **AI Model Integration**: Works with available models including GitHub Copilot Pro
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and informative error messages
6. **Dynamic Configuration**: Auto-detects and configures services

### 🔧 **What to Expect**:
- **Apps Mode**: Real GitHub data from your repositories
- **Web Mode**: Simulated web search results (demo)
- **AI Mode**: AI-generated responses using your available models
- **Unified Mode**: Combined results from all sources

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### If Apps Search Shows "No Services Configured":
1. Check if your GitHub token is stored: `localStorage.getItem('github_token')`
2. Manually configure GitHub in Integrations if needed
3. Check browser console for auto-configuration logs

### If No AI Models Appear:
1. Configure GitHub Copilot Pro token if you have subscription
2. Add OpenAI/Anthropic API keys if you have them
3. Demo model should always be available as fallback

### If Search Returns No Results:
1. Try simpler queries first
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Verify GitHub token has correct permissions

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know everything is working when:
- Apps mode returns your actual GitHub data
- AI mode shows your available models with 🚀 icons for Copilot Pro
- Web mode shows simulated results
- Unified mode combines all result types
- Console shows successful auto-configuration messages

**Your search functionality is now fully operational across all modes!** 🚀
