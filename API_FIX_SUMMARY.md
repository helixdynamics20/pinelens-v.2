# API Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JIRA API Endpoint Errors (404s)
**Problem**: The JIRA proxy endpoints were returning 404 errors instead of properly routing to the JIRA APIs.

**Root Cause**: 
- Incorrect proxy URL construction (`/api/jira-proxy/rest/api/3/...`)
- Complex dynamic proxy configuration not working as expected
- Authentication headers not being properly forwarded

**Solution**:
- **Removed proxy dependency** for JIRA and Bitbucket APIs
- **Updated to direct API calls** using the configured base URLs
- **Added proper CORS mode** (`mode: 'cors'`) to all fetch requests
- **Enhanced error logging** with response status and error text
- **Simplified vite.config.ts** to use basic CORS configuration

### 2. Authentication Flow Issues
**Problem**: Authentication was failing with 404 errors instead of proper 401/403 responses.

**Root Cause**: 
- Proxy was intercepting requests before they reached the actual APIs
- Headers weren't being properly passed through the proxy chain

**Solution**:
- **Direct API authentication** using Basic Auth headers
- **Proper credentials encoding** with btoa() for both Bitbucket and JIRA
- **Real-time connection testing** during configuration

### 3. CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Browser CORS restrictions were blocking API calls.

**Solution**:
- **Enabled CORS in Vite config** with `origin: true` and `credentials: true`
- **Added explicit CORS mode** to all fetch requests
- **Removed complex proxy configuration** that was causing conflicts

## Updated Service Architecture

### Enhanced API Methods
All JIRA and Bitbucket methods now use:
```typescript
const response = await fetch(url, { 
  headers,
  mode: 'cors'
});
```

### Direct URL Construction
Instead of proxy URLs like `/api/jira-proxy/rest/api/3/myself`, now using:
```typescript
const url = `${this.jiraConfig.baseUrl}/rest/api/3/myself`;
```

### Improved Error Handling
```typescript
if (response.ok) {
  return await response.json();
} else {
  const errorText = await response.text();
  console.error('üö´ API call failed:', response.status, errorText);
  throw new Error(`API call failed: ${response.status} - ${errorText}`);
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. JIRA Configuration Test
1. Open the application at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to Integrations ‚Üí In-House MCP
3. Configure JIRA with your real credentials:
   - **Base URL**: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`
   - **Email**: Your Atlassian email
   - **API Token**: Your JIRA API token
4. Click "Connect to JIRA"
5. Should see: `‚úÖ Connected to JIRA as [Your Name]`

### 2. Bitbucket Configuration Test
1. Configure Bitbucket with your credentials:
   - **Base URL**: `https://api.bitbucket.org`
   - **Username**: Your Bitbucket username
   - **App Password**: Your Bitbucket app password
   - **Workspace**: Your workspace name
2. Click "Connect to Bitbucket"
3. Should see: `‚úÖ Connected to Bitbucket as [Your Name]`

### 3. Search Functionality Test
1. After successful configuration, use the unified search
2. Try searching for repositories or JIRA issues
3. Results should appear without CORS errors

## Development Server Status
- **Running on**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **CORS Configuration**: Enabled for external API calls
- **Hot Module Reload**: Active for real-time updates

## Browser Console Monitoring
Look for these success indicators:
- `üîß Configuring JIRA...`
- `üåê Testing JIRA connection to: https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/myself`
- `üîë Using real JIRA credentials`
- `‚úÖ Connected to JIRA as [User Name]`

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting CORS Errors:
1. Ensure the dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. Verify API credentials are valid
4. Test API endpoints directly in Postman/curl

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Verify JIRA API token is correct and not expired
2. Check Bitbucket app password permissions
3. Ensure email/username matches your account
4. Try testing with demo mode first

## Next Steps
With these fixes, you should now be able to:
- ‚úÖ Successfully authenticate with real JIRA and Bitbucket APIs
- ‚úÖ Perform searches without CORS errors
- ‚úÖ See real data from your company's JIRA and Bitbucket instances
- ‚úÖ Use the unified search functionality

The application is now ready for real API integration testing!
