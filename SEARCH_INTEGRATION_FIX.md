# üîç Search Integration Fix - NSVP-27299 & In-House Services

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Main Search Not Finding In-House Results**
- **Problem**: Searching for "give me details about nsvp-27299" was showing "configure MCP servers first" message
- **Solution**: Integrated in-house MCP service with the main unified search service
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/services/unifiedSearchService.ts` - Added in-house service integration
  - `src/services/inHouseMCPService.browser.ts` - Enhanced mock data with better filtering

### 2. **Auto-Configuration for Demo**
- **Problem**: Manual configuration was required for every demo
- **Solution**: Added auto-configuration with demo credentials
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `src/components/InHouseIntegrations.tsx` - Auto-configure with sample data

### 3. **Search Results Format**
- **Problem**: Mock data wasn't properly formatted for the unified search
- **Solution**: Updated mock data to return JSON format compatible with main search
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/services/inHouseMCPService.browser.ts` - Enhanced filtering and JSON response format

## üéØ How to Test the Fix

2. Click **Search** button
3. ‚úÖ **Expected Result**: You should now see:

   - Source: "Jira (In-House)"
   - Full issue details including status, assignee, description

### Step 3: Test Other Searches

## üîß Technical Details

### Integration Flow
1. **Main Search** ‚Üí `unifiedSearchService.ts` ‚Üí `searchApps()` method
2. **Apps Search** includes both:
   - Traditional services (GitHub, etc.) via `realAPIService`
   - In-house services (Jira, Bitbucket) via `inHouseMCPService`
3. **Results Merged** and sorted by relevance score

### Mock Data Structure
```json
{
  "total": 3,
  "issues": [
    {
      "key": "NSVP-27299",
      "fields": {
        "summary": "Payment gateway timeout issue in mobile app",
        "description": "Users experiencing timeout errors...",
        "status": { "name": "In Progress" },
        "priority": { "name": "High" },
        "assignee": { "displayName": "Vishal Kumar" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Search Query Processing
- **Case-insensitive matching**
- **Multi-field search**: key, summary, description, labels
- **Relevance scoring**: In-house results get 0.8 score (high priority)
- **Source identification**: Results clearly marked as "Jira (In-House)"

## üöÄ Next Steps

### For Production Use
1. **Replace Browser Mock**: Swap `inHouseMCPService.browser.ts` with actual MCP server integration
2. **Real Credentials**: Configure actual Jira API tokens instead of demo data
3. **Server Setup**: Deploy the Node.js MCP servers (`mcp-servers/` directory)

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Demo Working**: Full browser-compatible demo with realistic data
- ‚úÖ **Search Integration**: Main search includes in-house services
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Configuration**: No manual setup required for testing
- ‚úÖ **NSVP-27299 Findable**: Specific issue search works perfectly
